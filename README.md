<h1 align="center">Alpha</h1>

Alpha is a pretty basic encryption "algorithm" made for fun.

# How it works
1. Once a string is passed in it gets reversed for some fun.
2. Each character of the string is converted to its numeric position on the alphabet.
3. The position is then converted to hex.
4. If the position is in the double-digits it is replaced with a unique unicode character.

The interesting part is the decryption since the actual encryption is basically nothing and took 10 minutes to decrypt. <br>
If you actually use it for anything then you should be in a mental asylum. <br>
I **might** make this better or create a new version of it for fun some other time.
